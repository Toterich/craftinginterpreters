# Golox - An implementation of the Lox programming language in Go

This project aims to be a full implementation of the Lox programming language designed by Robert Nystrom. It is intended as a learning exercise for me to achieve a deeper understanding of the different challenges involved with writing compilers, as well as learning more about Go.

## Roadmap

This project is still in an early WIP stage.

- [ ] Parsing and AST generation - 80%
- [ ] Basic Interpreter to directly walk the AST and execute statements - 80%
- [x] REPL - 100%
- [ ] Bytecode compilation - 0%
- [ ] Virtual Machine - 0%
- [ ] Optimization Passes - 0%
